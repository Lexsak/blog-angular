# Blog Angular

Blog Angular is a dynamic web application that serves as a platform for managing and showcasing blog posts. The application, built with Angular and interacting with a backend database (Firebase), provides a robust set of features for content creation, category management, user subscriptions, and more.

## Features

- **Category Navigation**: The navigation bar dynamically updates with categories managed by the admin. Clicking on a category redirects users to a page displaying posts related to that category.

- **Featured Posts**: The homepage displays a selection of featured posts to capture visitors attention.

- **Latest Posts**: A section showcasing the most recent blog posts, dynamically pulled from the database.

- **Newsletter Subscription**: Users can subscribe to the newsletter, and admin can view and manage subscribers from the admin panel.

- **About and Terms & Conditions Pages**: Simple pages providing information about the blog and its terms.

- **Detailed Post View**: Clicking on a post reveals a detailed view with tags, view count, last update timestamp, title, and description. On the right side, there are small tiles displaying similar posts from the same category.
